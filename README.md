# Elliptic-Curve-Cryptography

This code covers applications of ECC such as ECC using deffie hellman and using ECC for encrypting and decrypting.

# ECC using DH:

The Diffie-Hellman (DH) key exchange is a fundamental cryptographic technique that allows two parties to securely share a common secret over an insecure channel. When applied to elliptic curves, it is known as Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman (ECDH).

# Key Steps of ECDH:
Elliptic Curve Parameters: Both parties agree on a common elliptic curve and a base point 𝐺
on that curve.
# Key Pair Generation:
Each party generates a private key (a random integer) and computes the corresponding public key by multiplying the base point 
𝐺
G with their private key.
Public Key Exchange: The parties exchange their public keys.
# Shared Secret Computation:
Each party multiplies the received public key by their private key to compute a shared secret point on the elliptic curve.
The x-coordinate of this shared secret point is used as the shared secret.

# Advantages of ECDH:
Stronger Security with Smaller Keys: ECC provides robust security even with smaller key sizes, reducing computational load and improving performance.
Efficiency: Reduced key size means less storage space and faster computations, which is especially beneficial for devices with limited resources, such as mobile phones and IoT devices.

# Encryption/Decryption using ECC:

Point at Infinity
infinity: Represents the point at infinity (the identity element) on the elliptic curve.
Check if a Point is on the Curve
The is_on_curve function checks whether a given point lies on the elliptic curve.

Point Addition on the Curve
The point_addition function implements the addition of two points on the elliptic curve. This includes handling special cases like adding the point at infinity and doubling a point.

Scalar Multiplication on the Curve
The scalar_multiply function performs scalar multiplication of a point on the elliptic curve using the double-and-add method.

Generate ECC Key Pair
The generate_key_pair function generates a private key and a corresponding public key:

The private key is a random integer.
The public key is obtained by performing scalar multiplication of the base point 
𝐺
G by the private key.
Encrypt a Message using ECC
The encrypt function encrypts a message using the receiver's public key:

A random integer 
𝑘
k is chosen.
An ephemeral key is generated by multiplying 
𝑘
k with the base point 
𝐺
G.
The shared secret is computed by multiplying 
𝑘
k with the receiver's public key.
Each character of the message is XORed with the shared secret to produce the encrypted message.
Decrypt a Message using ECC
The decrypt function decrypts an encrypted message using the receiver's private key:

The shared secret is computed by multiplying the receiver's private key with the sender's public key.
Each character of the encrypted message is XORed with the shared secret to recover the original message.
